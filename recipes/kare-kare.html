    <h3>What is Kare Kare?</h3>
    <p>Arguably the most famous hodge podge of colorful vegetables and meaty goodness, Kare-kare has long made a name for itself in Filipino cuisine. And while attempts to recreate this succulent, rich mix of string beans, eggplant and varieties of meat may take quite some effort, we continue to patronize this beloved dish</p>

    <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the pork. Boil water in a large cooking pot. Add pork. Continue boiling for 35 minutes. Remove the pork from the pot and let it cook down. Rub salt all over and let it stay for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large pan. Once the oil gets really hot, fry the pork belly (skin side down). Note: BE CAREFUL! Splash 1 1/2 tablespoons of water on the oil every 3 minutes or until the skin gets golden brown and very crispy.</li>
      <li>Flip the pork and continue frying until the opposite side turns golden brown. Remove pork from the cooking pot and place it over a wire rack to let the excess oil drip. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Start to make the sauce. Grind the peanuts using a food processor until the texture becomes paste-like. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Make annatto water by soaking annatto seeds in hot water for 5 minutes. Constantly stir until the water turns deep orange. Filter the water using a kitchen strainer. You may discard the seeds afterwards. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a pan. Saute garlic and onion. Once the onion softens, add the peanut paste. Stir and cook for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Pour water and then stir until the mixture becomes smooth. Let the liquid boil.</li>
      <li>Add Knorr Pork Cube and annatto water. Cover and continue cooking for 3 minutes. Remove the cover and cook until the mixture reduces to your desired consistency. Add toasted rice powder. Mix well. Turn off the heat. Make sure to cover the pot to keep the sauce warm.</li>
      <li>Cook the vegetables by steaming. Arrange string bean, banana blossom, and eggplant on a steamer. Steam for 5 minutes. Add pechay and continue steaming for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Assemble your crispy kare-kare by combining the sauce, steamed vegetables, and crispy pork in one plate. Serve with rice and bagoong alamang. Share and enjoy!
